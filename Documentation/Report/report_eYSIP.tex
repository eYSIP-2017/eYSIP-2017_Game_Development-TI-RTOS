\qquad Real Time Systems is the reactive embedded systems where system has to perform various tasks within timeline. There are various software architecture for programming Real Time Systems. So this project deals with various concepts of Real Time Systems, Statechart design principles and developing various exercises based on TI-RTOS and Switch Case Statecharts. This project aims at developing software modules which will form the basis for any game that can be developed on the console.

\section*{Completion Status}
\qquad The requisite software modules for game development have been created successfully. Also game design approaches are fully covered. The following modules have been developed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flexible GLCD library for game objects display, robust Font library in two different sizes for display of text on GLCD and Tones library for playing any music and beeps using onboard buzzer,
    \item Working integration of statecharts with TI-RTOS for easier task scheduling.
    \item Statechart implementation exercises for an insight into the design approach, including \textit{The Vending Machine Controller}(with RTOS) and \textit{Timed Bomb Controller}(without RTOS) have been developed.
    \item Completely implemented \textit{Breakout} Game designed using Statechart Approach, implemented using Switch Case construct and TI-RTOS.(Some minor bugs exist, but should not hinder understanding of game design)

\section{Software used}
\subsection{Code Composer Studio}
\qquad \textit{Code Composer Studio (CCStudio or CCS)} is an integrated development environment (IDE) to develop applications for Texas Instruments (TI) embedded processors. It has complete Windows, Linux and Mac\footnote[1]{Please note that only microcontroller and connectivity devices are supported on Mac. Processors devices are not supported.} support for the entire Texas Instruments portfolio, including the board used for the project, i.e., Tiva C TM4C123GH6PM Launchpad.
\subsubsection{Version Used}
\qquad Code Composer Studio Version:7.1.0.00016 is used throughout the project. Installation of RTOS, and training material are accessible directly through the Resource Explorer in this version.

\subsection{Mikroelektronika GLCD Font Creator}
\qquad GLCD Font Creator enables the creation of personalized fonts, symbols and icons for LCDs and GLCDs. Create fonts and symbols from scratch, or by importing existing fonts on your system. It lets you modify and adjust them for your needs, apply effects and finally export them as source code for use in mikroC, mikroBasic or mikroPascal compilers.

\subsubsection{Downloading and Installing Mikroelektronika GLCD Font Creator}
Download the Windows Installer from their \href{https://download.mikroe.com/setups/additional-software/glcd-font-creator/glcd-font-creator-v120.zip}{official website}. The Install Wizard is pretty straightforward. \\
For macOS, download the same .exe. Then use Wine to open it(Tutorials on installing and using Wine on macOS can be found \href{https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/wine-mac/}{here}). 

\subsection{Hobbytronics BMP-LCD Converter}
\qquad This software converts a 2 colour BMP file into the hex character array that can be used in a program to display the graphic on the LCD screen. It can be downloaded from
\href{http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/download/BMP-LCD.zip}{here}. It requires no installation.

\section{Software and Code}
Three software systems are implemented during the course of the project. They are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Timed Bomb Controller
\item The Vending Machine Controller
\item The Breakout Game
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Timed Bomb Controller}
\subsection{Problem Statement}
\qquad The time bomb has a control panel with an GLCD that shows the current value of the timeout and three buttons: UP, DOWN, and ARM. The user begins with setting up the time bomb using the UP and DOWN buttons to adjust the timeout in one-second steps. Once the desired timeout is selected, the user can arm the bomb by pressing the ARM button. When armed, the bomb starts decrementing the timeout every second and explodes when the timeout reaches zero. An additional safety feature is the option to defuse an armed bomb by entering a secret code. The secret defuse code is a certain combination of the UP,DOWN and LEFT buttons. Of course, the defuse code must be correctly entered before the bomb times out.
\subsection{StateChart Solution}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm,height=10cm]{BombTimerStateChart}
\\{\small Fig a: TimerState Statechart} 
\end{center}
\qquad From the problem statement, the states of Timer Bomb over which its behaviour changes considerably are taken to be individual states of Timer Bomb.In this case, the Bomb Timer problem can be segregated into:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{{\small Idle}} State: \\ \qquad \qquad Perform basic initialization of 4 digit Timer, reset password and display animation.
    \begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle = \small, language = C]
        case idle:
          if(flag1 == 0)
          {
            // Display  once
              cal_time=120;
              glcd_frame1_write(); //Displays initial animation
              flag1=1;
          }
          break;
  \end{lstlisting}
  \item \textbf{{\small setTimer}} State: \\ \qquad \qquad Here UP and DOWN switches are used to set Timer. 4 Digit Timer is updated according to switch presses. MAX and MIN limits are 2 Minutes and 10 seconds respectively. RIGHT switch is used to arm bomb as illustrated in Fig a.
  \item \textbf{{\small autoTimer}} State: \\ \qquad \qquad In this state 4 Digit Timer starts decrementing till value reaches zero.  illustrated in Fig a.
      \begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle = \small, language = C]
  case autoTimer:
   // In autoTimer Mode, evaluate time and display the timer bits
      glcd_digit_write(bit_pos0,0);
      glcd_digit_write(bit_pos1,1);
      glcd_digit_write(bit_pos2,2);
      glcd_digit_write(bit_pos3,3);
      clear_section_glcd(2,0,78);
      glcd_bomb_write();
  // Switch to Bomb Explosion on Timeout
      if(cal_time==0)
      {
        flag5=1;
        flag4=0;
      }
  // Decrement Time
      if(cal_time>0)
      {
        cal_time--;
      }
      eval_time();
      break;
  \end{lstlisting}
  \item \textbf{{\small bombDiffused}} State: \\ \qquad \qquad No input from the user, but based on switch presses, the password is checked. Sequence is detected. If correct, Bomb is diffused. as illustrated in Fig a.
  \item \textbf{{\small bombExplode}} State: \\ \qquad \qquad No input from the user, but based on timer value. As Timer value reaches zero bomb Explodes. Animation for the same is displayed as illustrated in Fig a.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Program Code}
\qquad The git repository for the complete code can be found \href{https://github.com/eYSIP-2017/eYSIP-2017_Game_Development-TI-RTOS/tree/master/TimedBomb_Final}{here}. It contains the complete project folder used in CCS. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item The console support libraries are present in the \href{https://github.com/eYSIP-2017/eYSIP-2017_Game_Development-TI-RTOS/tree/master/TimedBomb_Final/Console}{Console} folder. 
  \item timedbomb.c is the main file. This contains the Statechart and  the Timer Bomb abstraction.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{The Vending Machine Controller}
\subsubsection{Problem Statement}
\qquad The overall objective is to design a vending machine controller. The system has five digital inputs and three digital outputs. You can simulate the system with five switches and three LEDs. The inputs are \textit{quarter, dime, nickel, regular soda and diet soda} . The quarter input will go high, then go low when a 25\textcent \  coin is added to the machine. The dime and nickel inputs work in a similar manner for the 10\textcent \  and 5\textcent \ coins. The sodas cost 35\textcent \ each. The user presses the soda button to select a regular soda and the diet button to select a diet soda. The GiveSoda output will release a regular soda if pulsed high, then low. Similarly, the GiveDiet output will release a diet soda if pulsed high, then low. The Change output will release a 5\textcent \ coin if pulsed high, then low.
\subsubsection{Statechart Solution}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=18cm]{VendingMachineStatechart1}
\\ {\small Fig a: Vending Machine Statechart Part 1}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=9cm]{VendingMachineStatechart2}
\\ {\small Fig b: Vending Machine Statechart Part 2}
\end{center}
\qquad From the problem statement, the states of vending machine over which its behaviour changes considerably are taken to be individual states of the vending machine. In this case, the vending machine problem can be segregated into:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{{\small INITM}} State: \\ \qquad \qquad Perform basic initialization of sum entered, number of regular and diet soda selected variables.
  \begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle = \small, language = C]
          case INITM:
            // Resets various variables.
            sum = 0;
            reg_n = 0;
            diet_n = 0;
            vm_mode = COIN;
            input = INITI; // for COIN state
            output = INITO; // for SELECT state
  \end{lstlisting}
  \item \textbf{{\small COIN}} State: \\ \qquad \qquad Switches correspond to coin entry, and coin entry GUI is displayed. (Unique Input and Output Behaviour). Internal transitions corresponding to each coin entry is as illustrated in Fig a.
  \item \textbf{{\small SELECT}} State: \\ \qquad \qquad Switches correspond to soda selection or cancel transaction, and Soda Selection GUI is displayed. It has internal state transitions corresponding to each selection as illustrated in Fig a.
  \item \textbf{{\small DELIVERY}} State: \\ \qquad \qquad No input from the user, but based on previous input, dispenses Regular Soda, Diet Soda and change through LED blinks and GLCD display. Internal transition between various states is as illustrated in Fig b.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{RTOS Implementation}
\qquad The use of statechart greatly simplifies task scheduling in RTOS. Here, basically two tasks are run as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{{\small readInput()}} Task: \\ \qquad \qquad Handles switch press inputs. Has an internal state machine(implemented using the switch case construct) running as shown in the following code snippet:
  \begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle = \small, language = C]
        switch(vm_mode){
        case INITM:
            break;
        case COIN:
            coinScreenInput();
            break;
        case SELECT:
            selectScreenInput();
            break;
        case DELIVERY:
            // No user input in delivery state
            break;
        }
  \end{lstlisting}
  \item \textbf{{\small displayOutput()}} Task: \\ \qquad \qquad Handles GLCD display and LED blink outputs. Also has an internal state machine(implemented using the switch case construct) running as shown in the following code snippet:
  \begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle = \small, language = C]
        switch(vm_mode){
        case INITM:
            // Resets various variables.
            sum = 0;
            reg_n = 0;
            diet_n = 0;
            vm_mode = COIN;
            input = INITI;
            output = INITO;
        case COIN:
            coinScreenDisplay(); // Displays GUI for 
            break;               // coin entry state
        case SELECT:
            selectScreenDisplay(); // Displays GUI 
            break;          // for soda select state
        case DELIVERY:
            deliveryOutput(); // Handles Soda and 
            break;          // coin dispensing
        }
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Program Code}
\qquad The git repository for the complete code can be found \href{https://github.com/eYSIP-2017/eYSIP-2017_Game_Development-TI-RTOS/tree/master/VendingMachine_Final}{here}. It contains the complete project folder used in CCS. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item The console support libraries are present in the \href{https://github.com/eYSIP-2017/eYSIP-2017_Game_Development-TI-RTOS/tree/master/VendingMachine_Final/Console}{Console} folder. 
  \item The font and graphic libraries are present in the \href{https://github.com/eYSIP-2017/eYSIP-2017_Game_Development-TI-RTOS/tree/master/VendingMachine_Final/Images}{Images} folder.
  \item VM\_RTOS.c is the main file. This contains the Statechart and RTOS implementation of the vending machine abstraction.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{The Breakout Game}
\subsubsection{Game Design}
\qquad The overall objective is to design the classic Breakout Game for the Tiva C Game Console, using the onboard peripherals.
The breakout game has a rectangular paddle at the bottom of the screen off which a moving ball ricochets off. At the top of the screen, it consists of rows of bricks. The victory condition is to clear the row of bricks, by hitting it with the ball. 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=8cm]{BreakoutDesign} \\
\caption{Fig a: The Breakout Game Concept}
\end{center}
\\ Our implementation of the game is to have 5 types of bricks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{HARD} brick - Takes 3 hits to disappear.
  \item \textit{MEDIUM} brick - Takes 2 hits to disappear.
  \item \textit{EASY} brick - Takes 1 hit to disappear.
  \item \textit{MAGIC1} brick - Delivers a hit to all surrounding bricks.
  \item \textit{MAGIC2} brick - Increases paddle size for 10 seconds.
\end{itemize}
There are 3 difficulty levels:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{EASY} - 3 lives, higher proportion of EASY bricks.
  \item \textit{MEDIUM} - 2 lives, higher proportion of MEDIUM bricks.
  \item \textit{HARD} - 1 life, higher proportion of HARD bricks.
\end{itemize}
Implicit above is an implementation of a life system(allowed number of retries for the player). There are three speeds for the ball:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{SLOW} - Ball moves slowly.
  \item \textit{MEDIUM} - Ball moves at an average speed.
  \item \textit{FAST} - Ball moves very fast.
\end{itemize}
Additionally, the game has the following screens:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Entry Cutscene
  \item Menu Screen
  \item Instructions Screen(Accessible from the menu)
  \item Settings Screen(Accessible from the menu)
  \item Gameplay Screen
  \item Victory Screen
  \item Game Over Screen
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Statechart Solution}
\qquad Since the game has several active components at the same time, it runs several parallel state machines each of which may or may not be independent of the other. The different state machines are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Ball Direction} State Machine \\
\includegraphics[width=14cm, height=16cm]{ballDirectionStatemachine} \\
\caption{Fig b: Ball Direction State Machine}
\item \textit{Brick Type} State Machine \\
\includegraphics[width=14cm, height=14cm]{brickTypeStatemachine} \\
